Jing's first machine learning project:
Naive Bayes Gaussian Algorithm.
This requires several libs:

- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Just a reminder: If you use Pycharm or other IDEs 
which utilize "venv" to virtualize the environment, 
then please setup your python project intepreter accordingly in the virtual environment
Otherwise, the virtual environment does not nessesarily to have the same packages as your linux.
